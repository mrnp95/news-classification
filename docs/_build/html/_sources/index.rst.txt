news-classification documentation
==================================

Welcome to **news-classification**'s documentation!
This site describes the end-to-end pipeline for fake vs. real news detection â€” from data loading to model evaluation and feature interpretation.

.. warning::
   **Critical Finding**: Our analysis revealed perfect correlation between the 'subject' field and labels, indicating severe data leakage. Models achieve 95-100% accuracy by learning source-specific patterns rather than genuine fake news indicators. See the Investigation Results section for details.
